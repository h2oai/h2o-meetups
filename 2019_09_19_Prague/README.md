### Talk 4: FastText Vector Norms And OOV Words by Vaclav Kosar

Word embeddings, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) in contrast to Word2vec model accounts for sub-word information by also embedding sub-word n-grams. FastText word representation is the word embedding vector plus the sum of n-grams contained in it. Word2vec vector norms have been shown (Schakel & Wilson, 2015) to be correlated to word significance. This talk discusses the visualization of vector norms of FastText embeddings and evaluates the use of FastText word vector norm multiplied with the number of word n-grams for detecting non-English OOV words.
