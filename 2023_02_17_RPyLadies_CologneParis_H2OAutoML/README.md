## Talk: AutoML in R & Python Using H2O

The focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning using the H2O machine learning platform in R.  H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O's AutoML algorithm.  H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets.  The result of the AutoML run is a "leaderboard" of H2O models which can be explained using the H2O Explainability interface and easily exported for use in production.
